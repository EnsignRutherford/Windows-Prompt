Description: Custom Command Processor prompt for Windows 10+.  
             Windows before version 10 has no native support for ANSI colors on the console, hence the original work in the article
             below has not worked since support for the MS-DOS subsystem was dropped, dropping ANSI.SYS support.
             An update to an article originally published in PC Magazine, originally dated March 28th, 1995 page 252.

             This now ONLY works on Windows 10+ as it takes advantages of specific codes and functions only available in Windows 10+.
